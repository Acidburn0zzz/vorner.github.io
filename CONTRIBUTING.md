While I value contributions in general, this repository is a *personal* blog
post.

In other words, it means I will listen to reports about inaccuracies, errors,
typos, etc. But this is not a community driven documentation. I want to be the
author of all the texts here. If you feel reformulating a sentence would make it
more readable, you might be right, but I probably won't accept it anyway.

But, once again, this is specific to just this one repository. Contributions to
other projects are more than welcome.
