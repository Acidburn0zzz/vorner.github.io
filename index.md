# Vorner's random stuff

* [Rust 2018](rust-2018.md)

## About me

* An average European, living in Prague.
* I'm a programmer (sometimes a computer magician, working with all colours of
  magic, including black).
* I like climbing. Maybe I'll write a post comparing Rust and climbing one day.
* And yes, self-appointed member of the Rust Evangelism Strike Force.
* I suffer from chronic lack of free time.

## About the pages

These were thrown together quite fast (see above). I also do have my [personal
web pages](https://vorner.cz/en), but they are really outdated and fell into
disrepair. You can have a look, if you really like a retro design.

This is here mostly for the technical stuff, like Rust.
